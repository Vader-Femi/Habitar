# Habitar
<a href="https://github.com/Vader-Femi/Habitar/" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Live Demo"><u>Live Demo ðŸš€(Coming soon)</u></a>

A habit-tracking app using Flutter, configured with [Bloc], [Hydrated Bloc], and [Flutter Super] for a robust and dynamic state management. 
Applied clean architecture principles to ensure a clear separation of features. 
Leveraged Firebase for [authentication], [cloud storage], and [crashlytics], enabling secure, scalable, and debuggable access.
Also integrated [drift] as local database to enable offline access  
Incorporated push notifications with [flutter_local_notifications] to remind users of their goals based on customized parameters, promoting habit consistency across Android and iOS platforms.

# First Run

After installing the package dependencies with

```
flutter pub get
```

run the code generation tool

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## ApiService

Abstraction over the firebase communication that defines (all) firebase functions.
Network functions return DataSuccess or DataFailed which are implementations of the abstract [DataState] class

- [AuthApiService] - Firebase Auth related functions
- [HomeApiService] - Habit and Firebase Firestore related functions
- [DataState] - An abstract class of Generic type that contains the network response or error

[AuthApiService]: lib/features/auth/data/sources/auth_service.dart
[HomeApiService]: lib/features/home/data/sources/home_service.dart
[DataState]: lib/core/res/data_state.dart

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed in the [`service_locator.dart`][service_locator] file. This sample uses [GetIt], a lightweight service locator.

[service_locator]: ./lib/service_locator.dart
[GetIt]: https://pub.dev/packages/get_it


## Features
This app has 4 feature [Splash], [Choose Mode], [Auth], and [Home] 

### Splash
Contains the splash screen page that checks if user is logged in, then routes accordingly. I has a 1 second delay before routing.

### Choose Mode
Simply contains a hydrated bloc class that stores the theme preference (dark or light mode).
It is used in the main class and is set to use whatever theme mode the device happens to be in by default.

### Auth
Is divided into data, domain, and presentation
- Data: Contains the model classes, repository implementation, and the [AuthApiService]
- Domain: Contains the entity classes, repository definition, and the use cases for auth activities like sign in and sign up.
- Presentation: Contains the bloc along with state and event classes, auth widgets, and the 4 auth pages.

[Auth]: lib/features/auth

### Home
Is divided into data, domain, and presentation
- Data: Contains the model classes, repository implementation, [drift] database classes, [flutter_local_notifications] related classes, and the [HomeApiService]
- Domain: Contains the entity classes, repository definition, and the use cases for activities that can be performed on habits like adding, deleting, etc.
- Presentation: Contains the [Flutter Super] state classes, habit screens widgets, and the 5 pages for interacting with habits.

[Home]: lib/features/home

## Logger
This project uses firebase [crashlytics] to log error and crashes

## Future recommendations
Add a function to cancel all notifications assigned for a specific day whenever a habit is marked as completed for that day
This might involve updating how the notification id is generated.
