rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Live Demo"><u>Live Demo ðŸš€(Coming soon)</u></a>

A habit-tracking app using Flutter, configured with [Bloc], [Hydrated Bloc], and [Flutter Super] for a robust and dynamic state management. 
Applied clean architecture principles to ensure a clear separation of features. 
Leveraged Firebase for [authentication], [cloud storage], and [crashlytics], enabling secure, scalable, and debuggable access.
Also integrated [drift] as local database to enable offline access  
Incorporated push notifications with [flutter_local_notifications] to remind users of their goals based on customized parameters, promoting habit consistency across Android and iOS platforms.
